I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze retail sales data using SQL queries for backend data transformation. The dashboard offers detailed insights into revenue trends, profit margins, and sales quantity across various markets and stores. Key KPIs such as:

Total Revenue: ₹960M

Sales Quantity: 2M units

Total Profit Margin: ₹24.66M

Top Revenue-Contributing Market: Delhi NCR (52.9%)

Highest Profit % Market: Surat (5.1%)

Lowest Performing Market: Bengaluru (-17.2% profit)

The dashboard enables stakeholders to track performance by market, store, and month, while highlighting declining trends post-2019, supporting strategic decision-making. It also includes filters for Year and Month-wise analysis and compares Revenue vs. Last Year’s Performance.

All data queries and aggregations were performed using SQL, ensuring clean and optimized datasets for reporting.
